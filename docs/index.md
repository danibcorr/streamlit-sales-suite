# 🐍 Python Project Template

Welcome to the **Python Project Template** repository! This template is designed to help
you quickly set up a Python project with essential tools and best practices for **code
quality, security, complexity analysis, testing, and deployment**. Whether you’re
starting a new project or looking to standardize your development workflow, this template
provides a solid foundation.

For more details about the tools and configurations used in this project, see the
[Content](./content/content.md) page.

## 📰 Features

- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrated with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for
  automatic code formatting, [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting,
  and [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking.
- **Security Analysis**: Uses [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to
  identify common security issues in your Python code.
- **Code Complexity Analysis**: Integrated with
  [Complexipy](https://rohaquinlop.github.io/complexipy/) to measure and analyze the
  complexity of the codebase.
- **Testing**: Built-in support for [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for
  running tests and ensuring code correctness.
- **Documentation**: Uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for generating beautiful
  documentation websites, with the
  [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
- **Deployment**: Easily deploys documentation to
  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
